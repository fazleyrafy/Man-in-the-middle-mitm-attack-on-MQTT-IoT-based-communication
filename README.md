# Man-in-the-middle-mitm-attack-on-MQTT-IoT-based-communication
A complete tutorial and toolkit for demonstrating a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the MQTT protocol. This project is for educational and cybersecurity research purposes to understand IoT vulnerabilities. Includes Python (Asyncio, Paho-MQTT) for a payload-injection proxy and bash scripts using ettercap (ARP spoofing) and iptables.
